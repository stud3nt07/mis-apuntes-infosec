# 1 Vulnerability Management  
## Main Questions 
A. How easly can attackers exploit the vulnerability  
B. Do any available patches address the vulnerability  
C. What type of data does the vulnerability expose  
D. How many systems does this vulnerability  

# 2 Penetration Testing
## four steps 
1. Planning: scope , objetives, target systems and restriccions.
2. How will you collect, create and report relevant threat intelligence (information - gathering)
3. Testing, What methods of atack  will you use (typs of attacks)
4. Reporting, How will you share your findings and recomendatios with the client
   ### Tools:
   - Networks mappers
   - Port scanners
   - vulnerability scanner (burp suit, owasp zap, etc
   - packet analyzer
   ### Tools for attacking:
   * Exploitation frameworks provide repositories of prebuilt attacks and exploits. Consider the Metasploit project, a tool for finding existing exploits or sharing your own.
   * Password-cracking tools
