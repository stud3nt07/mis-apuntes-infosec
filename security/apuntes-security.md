# 1 Vulnerability Management  
## Main Questions 
A. How easly can attackers exploit the vulnerability  
B. Do any available patches address the vulnerability    
  -firmware was updated?      
C. What type of data does the vulnerability expose  
D. How many systems does this vulnerability  

Note: Implement a firewall

# 2 Penetration Testing
## four steps 
1. Planning: scope , objetives, target systems and restriccions.
2. How will you collect, create and report relevant threat intelligence (information - gathering)
3. Testing, What methods of atack  will you use (typs of attacks)
4. Reporting, How will you share your findings and recomendatios with the client
   ### Tools:
   - Networks mappers
   - Port scanners
   - vulnerability scanner (burp suit, owasp zap, etc
   - packet analyzer
   ### Tools for attacking:
   * Exploitation frameworks provide repositories of prebuilt attacks and exploits. Consider the Metasploit project, a tool for finding existing exploits or sharing your own.
   * Password-cracking tools

   # 3 System Security   
   1 Implementing patch management    
   2 Disabling unnecessary ports and services   
   3 Enabling event logging   
   4 Using secure authentication   
   5 Backing up data
